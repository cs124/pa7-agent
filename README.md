# Programming Assignment 7: Agent!

**Late days CANNOT be used on this assignment. Please submit early and often to avoid last minute submission issues!**

**You should work in groups of 3-4 members. (To work in a group of size 2, you must get special permission from the staff.) All submissions will be graded according to the same criteria, regardless of group size.**

In this assignment you will build a customer service agent that can help with movie ticket bookings and other movie-related requests.
The assignment consists of a two parts. In the first part, you will implement the collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend movies to the user. In the second part, you will implement an LLM agent that can make tool calls to take on web search and memory functionalities.

By the end of the assignment, you will submit:

- Code file (`agent.py`), which includes implementations for part 1 and 2.
- A text file showing a full transcript of the agent's conversation with the user covering all the features you implemented for Part 1 (`transcript_part1.txt`)
- A text file showing a full transcript of the agent's conversation with the user covering all the features you implemented for Part 2 (`transcript_part2.txt`)
- [extra credit]: If you want to attempt the extra credit part of the assignment, you will submit your implementation in extra_credit.py along with a transcript `extra_credit_transcript.txt`

## Important Setup Note

### Environment

Although this assignment mostly reuses the environment you set up in PA0, we need one additional package. You have two options to setup the new environment:

- First, activate your cs124 environment. Then, download additional required libraries:

    conda activate cs124
    pip install -U dspy together beautifulsoup4 mem0ai serpapi google-search-results

- Create a new environment just for PA7:

    conda env create -f environment_pa7.yml
    conda activate cs124_pa7

### Together API key

Make a new python script called `api_keys.py`. Inside the script, insert your own API key in the string:

    import os
    TOGETHER_API_KEY = ""
    os.environ["TOGETHER_API_KEY"] = TOGETHER_API_KEY

IMPORTANT: Each group has a limited amount of API credit, and you should budget your usage accordingly. We recommend that you test your functions individually to minimize the amount of API calls you make. Every time you run repl.py, the API budget will be reduced.

## Starter Code

We have provided an interface code file for you: `repl.py`. It's a common pattern in software engineering known as the Read-Eval-Print-Loop, or REPL for short. The REPL creates a prompt that gets an input string from the user. Then the REPL passes the input to an agent class that is responsible for doing the work. The response generated by the agent class is then handled again by the REPL, which prints the response and waits for more input.

In the starter code folder, fire up the REPL by issuing the following command:
`python repl.py`

You can type your message in the prompt to the movie agent, and hit enter. To exit the REPL, write `:quit`.

All the code that you will need to write for this assignment will be in `agent.py`. We will describe the components that you will need to implement in the next sections.

## Part 1: Basic Tool-Use Agent (50 points)

### First Tool: Recommend Movies via Collaborative Filtering (25 points)

One of the core functions that your agent has to support is recommending movies to the user. This is a classic problem in recommender systems, and we will use the collaborative filtering algorithm to solve it. Specifically, you will need to implement the `binarize`, `similarity`, and `recommend_movies` functions in `agent.py`.

We have included the movie ratings matrix in `data/ratings.txt`. You can load it using the `util.load_ratings` function. Moreover, we have populated some synthetic user profiles in `synthetic_users.py` (which you should not modify because our test cases rely on them). The `recommend_movies` function takes in the user name and the number of movies to recommend, and returns a list of movie titles to recommend based on collaborative filtering. You should implement item-item collaborative filtering with cosine similarity with no mean-centering or normalization of scores.

Here is an example of what you should expect to see when you run the REPL:

```python
recommend_movies("Peter", 3)
['Back to the Future (1985)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark) (1981)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)']
```

You should expect your list of movies to match exactly the ones in the example above if you implement the function correctly. And we can see that the result makes sense because Peter is a sci-fi fan based on his profile in `synthetic_users.py`.

### Integrating Tools into an LLM Agent (5 points)

Now that we have built a `recommend_movies` function, we can integrate it into an LLM agent so that it can make tool calls to the `recommend_movies` function. We will use the DSPy library to build our agent to make tool calling easier.

We have provided a `MovieTicketAgent` class in `agent.py` that you can use as a starting point. We have also provided a `general_qa` function that you can use to answer general questions about the movie ticket agent.

To add these tools to your agent, you can simply add them to the `tools` list in the `react_agent` variable. DSPy will automatically implement the ReAct framework for you (based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) to interleave reasoning and tool calls.

```python
react_agent = dspy.ReAct(
    MovieTicketAgent,
    tools = [
        recommend_movies,
        general_qa,
    ]
)
```

You can then run the REPL script to see your agent in action: `python repl.py`.

You should expect to see your agent making tool calls to the `recommend_movies` function and answering general questions about the movie ticket agent. Here is an example of what you should expect to see:

```text
Movie Ticket Agent> Hello! I'm the Movie Ticket Agent. How can I help you today?
> My name is Peter, recommend 3 movies to me.
Movie Ticket Agent>
Prediction(
    trajectory={'thought_0': 'I need to recommend 3 movies to Peter. I will use the recommend_movies tool to generate a list of movie titles for him.', 'tool_name_0': 'recommend_movies', 'tool_args_0': {'user_name': 'Peter', 'k': 3}, 'observation_0': ['Back to the Future (1985)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark) (1981)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)'], 'thought_1': 'I have successfully recommended 3 movies to Peter: "Back to the Future", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi". Now, I will ask Peter if he would like to book a ticket for any of these movies.', 'tool_name_1': 'finish', 'tool_args_1': {}, 'observation_1': 'Completed.'},
    reasoning='I recommended 3 classic movies to Peter based on his request. The movies are "Back to the Future," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi." I have completed the recommendation process and am ready to assist him further if he wishes to book a ticket for any of these films.',
    process_result='I have recommended the following 3 movies to you, Peter: "Back to the Future," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi." Let me know if you would like to book a ticket for any of these!'
)

> give me a plot summary for "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"
Movie Ticket Agent>
Prediction(
    trajectory={'thought_0': 'The user is asking for a plot summary of "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi." Since this request does not involve booking tickets or any other specific action related to movie tickets, I will use the general question answering tool to provide the plot summary.', 'tool_name_0': 'general_qa', 'tool_args_0': {'user_request': 'give me a plot summary for "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"'}, 'observation_0': ['"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" follows the Rebel Alliance\'s final efforts to defeat the Galactic Empire.

The film concludes with a sense of hope and renewal, as the heroes reflect on their journey and the future ahead.'], 'thought_1': 'I have successfully provided the user with a plot summary for "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi."

The film follows the Rebel Alliance\'s final efforts to defeat the Galactic Empire, highlighting Luke Skywalker\'s journey to rescue Han Solo, confront Darth Vader, and ultimately bring balance to the Force.'
)
```

Here we are printing the trajectories including the tool calls and observations. You can see that the agent first recommends 3 movies to the user, and then answers the general question about the plot summary of "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" by making a tool call to the `general_qa` tool. In your submission, make sure your transcript includes the full trajectories like this too so that we can judge whether your agent made the right tool calls.

### Interfacing with Databases (20 points)

An important part of building a customer service agent is to be able to interface with databases to gather and record information about the user and the movies. As a starting point, implement the `book_ticket` tool in `agent.py` and integrate them into your agent.

We have created a mini movie showtime database in `agent.py` that you can use to gather information about the movies and help with movie booking requests. When your agent booked a new ticket, make sure to update the `ticket_database` and deduct the ticket price from the user's balance. For any requests that can't be handled by your agent, make a human customer support request by calling the `file_request` tool to add the request to the `request_database`. Your should print the databases whenever you make new updates to them.

Here is an example of what you should expect to see when you run the REPL:

```text
user> alright book a ticket for Peter for Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi
Movie Ticket Agent>
Prediction(
    trajectory={'thought_0': 'I need to book a ticket for Peter for the movie "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi".', 'tool_name_0': 'book_ticket', 'tool_args_0': {'user_name': 'Peter', 'movie_title': 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi'}, 'observation_0': 'Ticket booked successfully for Peter for the movie Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi.

I should now check his balance to confirm the new amount after the ticket purchase.', 'tool_name_1': 'find_balance', 'tool_args_1': {'user_name': 'Peter'}, 'observation_1': 24.0, 'thought_2': 'The ticket has been booked and the balance confirmed. The task is now complete.', 'tool_name_2': 'finish', 'tool_args_2': {}, 'observation_2': 'Completed.'},
    reasoning='I successfully booked a ticket for Peter for the movie "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi". The booking was confirmed, and I also checked his balance after the purchase, which is now 24.0.',
    process_result='The ticket has been booked successfully for Peter. The ticket number is fmbbto, and his new balance is 24.0.'
)
user> print ticket_database

Printing ticket_database:
{'fmbbto': Ticket(user_name='Peter', movie_title='Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi', time=Date(year=2025, month=11, day=15, hour=13, minute=0))}

You can book tickets through platforms like Fandango, AMC Theatres, or your local cinema\'s website. Additionally, I recommended some similar movies: \n1. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\n2. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\n3. Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nIf you would like to book a ticket for any of these movies or have any other questions, feel free to ask!'

user> print request_database
Printing request_database:

{'3th6rd': Request(user_request='can you give me a discount on Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi?', user_name='')}
```

### Transcript and Submission for Part 1

Once you have finished the above, generate a transcript of the agent's conversation with the user covering the following user questions:

```text
- My name is Peter, recommend 3 movies to me.
- recommend 5 movies to Amy please
- Give me a plot summary for "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"
- Book a ticket for Peter for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
- print ticket_database
- My name is Peter. Can you give me a discount on Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers?
- print request_database
```

Apart from the above transcript, you are also encouraged to add additional user questions that can showcase the use of all the tools you implemented. Make sure that you save the full trajectories of the agent's responses as we showed above in your transcript. Save the transcript as `transcript_part1.txt`.

## Part 2: Real-World Extensions (50 points)

So far, our agent is still quite toy -- it relies on some synthetic user profiles and a fake movie database. Now it's your turn to extend your agent to support more functionalities that would make it useful in a real-world scenario.
Your task is to implement functions that could support the following functionalities.
We will grade your implementation based on the interaction transcript that your agent has with the user.

### Function 1: Web Search (25 points)

Often times our LLMs don't know the latest information (say you want to know about a new movie that's coming out soon).
To overcome this, we want to integrate web search (through a search API) so that your agent can browse the latest information. Generally we can break this down into several steps: calling the web search tool, parsing the results, and using the results to answer the user's question.

There are many search APIs out there that are free for low-volume usage. One example is the Bing Search API through [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/bing-search-api?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22795996758&gbraid=0AAAAADD8kqMYKIj4OU0jh5T2CDRegl0W8&gclid=CjwKCAiAlfvIBhA6EiwAcErpyVhlhSJIBshjm4vojNUuHzVO7x4PzQEA9kT4l5ys2SvhmvcRFnZTERoCxw4QAvD_BwE).
To get an API key, you will need to register a free account, click subscribe, then go to the dashboard [here](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key) to get your API key. After you generate the key, please add the following lines to `api_keys.py`, and enter your own SerpAPI key into the string.

```python
SERPAPI_API_KEY = ""
os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = SERPAPI_API_KEY
```

Once you have an API key, you call the web search tool like the following:

```python
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "bing",
    "q": "knives out 2025",
    "api_key": "your_api_key"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()
```

You can get the list of links from the results dictionary by:

```python
links = [
    item.get("link")
    for item in results.get("organic_results", [])
    if item.get("link")
]
```

You might want to handle pagination of the results too if the results are too many.

Once you get a link, you can read its content with tools like BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract_text(html: str) -> str:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")

    # Remove scripts/css/ads
    for tag in soup(["script", "style", "noscript"]):
        tag.decompose()

    text = soup.get_text(separator=" ", strip=True)
    return " ".join(text.split())
```

By reading the content of the searched results, the agent should be able to give more accurate and up-to-date information to the user, for example, it should be able to handle a query like "do a web search and then tell me about the upcoming knives out movie in 2025."

In `agent.py`, we provide a helper function `extract_text` and a `WebTools` class that offers basic functionalities for performing web search by calling the serpapi.

Your job is to add the relevant tools to the enhanced agent class (`EnhancedMovieTicketAgent`). Specicially, you will need to add web search tools if web search is enabled.

To test the agent's search capabilities, replace `react_agent` with `enhanced_agent` in `repl.py` before you run `repl.py`.

To receive full credits, you need to demonstrate that the agent can perform web search to access the latest information. Our Gradescope autograder will evaluate this functionality.

### Function 2: Memory (25 points)

You might notice that the current agent is stateless: it doesn't remember past interactions with the user and you have to explain who you are at every interaction.
Try to implement a memory system so that your agent can remember past interactions with the user and use that memory to personalize the conversation.
You can assume that within each interaction, the user is the same person.

There are many ways to implement the memory system. We will use a library called [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0). In `agent.py`, we initialize the memory system like the following:

```python
from mem0 import Memory

# Configure environment
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"

# Initialize Mem0 memory system
memory_config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "together",
        "config": {
            "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct",
            "temperature": 0.1
        }
    },
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "together",
        "config": {
            "model": "Alibaba-NLP/gte-modernbert-base"
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "embedding_model_dims": 768
        }
    }
}
```

We provide the starter code for the `MemoryTools` class, which includes functions that store, search, fetch, and update memories. Now, your job is as follows:

1. Finish writing the `search_memories` function. Specifically, define results by searching for the relevant memory. Please read the documentation here (the function `chat_with_memories` might be helpful): https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0.

2. Now that we have a `MemoryTools` class working, we can integrate it with our `DSPy ReAct` agent in `EnhancedMovieTicket` Agent. Your job is to add the relevant tools to the agent so that the agent can call the tools when needed.

To test the agent's memory capabilities, replace `react_agent` with `enhanced_agent` in `repl.py` before you run `repl.py`. After you have implemented both the web search and memory functions, you should end up with an agent that can both handle web searches and remember important user information!

This is just a minimal demo to illustrate the memory capabilities of the agent, for more details, you can refer to this tutorial: https://dspy.ai/tutorials/mem0_react_agent/.

### Transcript and Submission for Part 2

Similar to Part 1, include the above example queries as well as additional user questions that can showcase the use of all the tools you implemented. Save the transcript as `transcript_part2.txt`. You should make sure to showcase that the agent is able to remember past interactions with the user and use that memory to personalize the conversation, and that it can make tool calls to the web search tool and answer questions based on the latest information.

## EXTRA CREDIT: a new feature of your choice!

Besides web search and memory, there are many other features that can make the agent even more powerful. To receive extra credit on the assignment, come up with an additional feature besides web search and memory and use `DSPy` to show case the additional feature. Feel free to be creative! We've provided a starter file `extra_credit.py` for you to get started. Your job is to implement the additional feature and provide transcripts that illustrate the feature. At the top of your transcript, please explain what feature you were trying to implement.
