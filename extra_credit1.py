Extra Credit Assignment (Option 1)

In this assignment, you will create your own AI agent using DSPy and any tools/APIs you choose.

Your agent should:
1. Use DSPy's framework (signatures, modules, etc.)
2. Implement some interesting functionality beyond basic chat
3. Demonstrate your implementation with a working example

You have complete freedom to:
- Choose what your agent does (data analysis, creative generation, web search, memory, etc.)
- Select which APIs or libraries to integrate
- Design the interface and interaction pattern

Some ideas to get you started:
- A memory-enhanced conversational agent
- A research assistant that uses web search
- A creative writing collaborator with style adaptation
- A data analysis agent that processes files
- A multi-step reasoning agent for complex problems
- Something completely different! Be creative!

Complete the TODOs below to build your agent.
